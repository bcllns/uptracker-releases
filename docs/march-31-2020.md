### Fixed

Inventory:  When a user selects a different Location at the top, the "Quantity Slider Bar" in the Inventory page view does not change the Qtys for the new location.

Marketplace:  When a user clicks on "Add Product - Custom Product" it causes an error

Shopping List:  A user can't close the drop-down list when he clicks in the "Ship To" in Checkout.

Marketplace:  When a user uses the grid view and they click the "Select all" , it checks all the boxes, then if they un-check the "Select All" the check-boxes do not deactivate the boxes.

### Updated

Inventory: Update all filters for every location in the Inventory tab

Vendors:  The "Remove from my list" button is overlapped by Chat button on Vendor tab at the bottom of the screen
