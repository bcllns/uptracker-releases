### Fixed

* Inventory:  When a user clicks on "Filter" and they click on any option, they get an error.
* Marketplace/Shopping List:  If a user adds a product to the shopping list, then go to the Shopping List and comes back to the Marketplace to order another product, with a different vendor,  that product, does not appear in the shopping list. 
* Orders:  When trying to void a line in "Order items" under  "Open", the wrong id is sent within the program, The id being sent is for a line in "Orders" under "Open", causes the item not to be voided.

### Update

* Inventory:  On Step 3, remove the "Vendor" selector button
* Marketplace: Move the "Filter" section button in Global Marketplace so it is not crowding the "Keyword Search" button.
* Users:  On the page where you update your password, move down the "Change" button.
