### Fixed

* Locations: The "Help" text button for "Location Type" drop-down field doesn't match the screen size, overlaps the field
* Marketplace: When adding a Custom product, on step 3, the "Next" button is staying gray - you need to select another unit type, then the default "Unit" and the "Next" button turns blue

### Updated

* Inventory: When in the "grid" mode, hide "eye" button on the far right on each product line
