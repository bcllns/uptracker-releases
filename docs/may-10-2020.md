### Fixed

* Marketplace: When you click on a MSDS link in Product Info, the link was bringing you to the dashboard instead of a new page to open the link.
* General: If there is a keyword search on the page, focus the cursor in the Text box when the view is loading
* Registration: No error image appears when user tries to add an invalid credit card during onboarding
